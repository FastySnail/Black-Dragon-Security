                <h2>It Affects Everyone</h2>
                <p>In today's hyper-connected world, cyber attacks have far-reaching impacts, 
				affecting everyone. Hackers can influence major businesses, stock markets, and 
				essential infrastructures from any location. When a corporation is breached, it suffers financial losses, 
				legal issues, and a damaged reputation, impacting employees, 
				shareholders, and customers. Stock markets react to cyber 
				incidents, causing fluctuations and investor panic, which can erase 
				billions in market value quickly. Cybercriminals also target critical 
				sectors like healthcare, energy, and government, disrupting services and jeopardizing public safety. Black Dragon Security 
				offers robust solutions to counter these threats, ensuring that one cyber incident doesn't trigger a global crisis.
