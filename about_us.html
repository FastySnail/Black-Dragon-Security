         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>During the cold war the need for Cyber Security ramped up signifently and has not slowed down since, In 2009 Timothy Wheeler
		 graduated from the local college W SCHOOL with a degree in Cyber Security. Since Timothy had been a young boy growing up on the family farm, technolgy
		 had always fascinated him, from when the first ever computer wasat the local store to when he was 12 and his family bought their first
		 computer he knew he wanted to make a career out of technolgy. After he graduated and was figuring out what to do with his life his long time friend Zain wilson
		 presented him with a business venture that also doubled as a school project for his Web
		Design class, this venture let to the founding of Black Dragon Security in 2010.
